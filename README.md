# Neural Machine Translation

This is an optional assignment. If you complete this assignment, it can only increase your grade.

## Assignment

* Implement a Python neural machine translation program using the code provided in Chapters 8 & 9 of Neural Machine Translation by Philipp Koehn.
  * You may use the following code, but I encourage you not to. Instead I encourage you to create the files from scratch, working from the book.
    * http://statmt.org/nmt-book/code/nmt.py
    * http://statmt.org/nmt-book/code/decoder.py

* Use the following parallel data:
  * http://statmt.org/nmt-book/code/Tanzil.20k.de-en.de
  * http://statmt.org/nmt-book/code/Tanzil.20k.de-en.en

* Using LaTeX and the style files provided for the project, write a short (1-4 pages) paper describing the results of your code. I encourage you to graph loss versus epochs, experiment with various GPU batch sizes, and to experiment with one or more of the suggestions in ยง9.7 of the Neural Machine Translation textbook.
